# What factors drive consumer interest rates?  
 
This project explores this question using the Prosper Loan dataset with Python and Seaborn visualiztions.  The Prosper loan dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate, current loan status, borrower income, and others.

Inquiry: Investigated patterns in loans including amount, borrower rate, current loan status, borrower income, and others to help stakeholders/lenders understand the composition of their portfolio and identify risks and opportunities.

Tools & Methods: The data set was pretty clean overall.  I had to change data types to datetime or categorical as required, and transformed the IncomeRange, EmploymentStatus, and LoanStatus variables/colums to ordered categorical data types and the map function.  Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to visualize and explore different variables and correlations.

Recommendation: In policy that addresses U.S. student debt consider region, ethnicity, and college size to determine how graduates actually experience the U.S. college debt crisis.
